"to import numpy into your project , you will use the import statement and give numpy an alias to be used,e.g np"
"input"
import numpy as np

"The central feature of NumPy is the array object class. Arrays are similar to lists in Python,
except that every element of an array must be of the same type, typically a numeric type like
float or int. Arrays make operations with large amounts of numeric data very fast and are
generally much more efficient than lists."

"to create an array give the array a variable name,e.g a,b,c, then  assign the numpy array object to the given name"
"in the example below we assigned a datatype, i.e float to the array"
"input"
 a = np.array([1, 4, 5, 8], float)
 
 "input"
  a
  
  "output"
  array([ 1., 4., 5., 8.])
  
  
  "to find out the type of object an output or input variable  is e.g , what type of data is the variable a above?"
  "input"
   type(a)
   
   "output"
   type 'numpy.ndarray'
