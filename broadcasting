"However, arrays that do not match in the number of dimensions will be broadcasted by Python
to perform mathematical operations. This often means that the smaller array will be repeated
as necessary to perform the operation indicated. Consider the following:"


"The term broadcasting describes how numpy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. There are, however, cases where broadcasting is a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that slows computation."

"input"
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], float)
b = np.array([-1, 3], float)
a
 
"output"
([[ 1., 2.],
 [ 3., 4.],
 [ 5., 6.]])

 "output"
 ([-1., 3.])
 
 "input"

 "output"
 ([[ 0., 5.],
 [ 2., 7.],
 [ 4., 9.]])
 
 
 
 "Python automatically broadcasts arrays in this manner. Sometimes, however, how we should
broadcast is ambiguous. In these cases, we can use the newaxis constant to specify how we
want to broadcast:"

"input"
 a = np.zeros((2,2), float)
 b = np.array([-1., 3.], float)
 a 
 
 "output"
 ([[ 0., 0.],
 [ 0., 0.]])
 
 "input"

 "output"
 ([-1., 3.])
 
 "input"
 a + b
 
 "output"
 ([[-1., 3.],
 [-1., 3.]])
 
 "input"
 a + b[np.newaxis,:]
 
 "output"
 ([[-1., 3.],
 [-1., 3.]])

  a + b[:,np.newaxis]
  
  "output"

 "In addition to the standard operators, NumPy offers a large library of common mathematical
functions that can be applied elementwise to arrays. Among these are the functions: abs,
sign, sqrt, log, log10, exp, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos,
arctan, sinh, cosh, tanh, arcsinh, arccosh, and arctanh."
